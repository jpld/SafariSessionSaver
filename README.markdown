[SafariSessionSaver](http://github.com/jpld/SafariSessionSaver/)
=============
SafariSessionSaver is a [Safari 5](http://www.apple.com/safari/) [Extension](http://safariextensions.tumblr.com/) to save and restore browsing sessions. originally written as a [RubyCocoa](http://rubycocoa.sourceforge.net/) command-line tool, sss sat atop Leopard frameworks, [Scripting Bridge](http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ScriptingBridgeConcepts/Introduction/Introduction.html) and [Bridge Support](http://bridgesupport.macosforge.org/) to communicate with [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/).

until a proper interface is crated, one interacts with SafariSessionSaver through the two buttons placed in his/her toolbar when the extension is enabled. the left button stores the current browsing session and the right recalls the stored session - at present, SafariSessionSaver only allows a single browsing session to be stored.
